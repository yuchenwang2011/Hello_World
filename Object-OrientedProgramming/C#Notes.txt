1. C# vs .NET
   C# is the programming language
   .Net is the framework for building applications on Windows
   .NET is used to be compared with JVM.

2. .NET has 2 main components:
   CLR: Common Language Runtime
   Class Library

3. C# learned the idea from Java that JVM translate the code to byte code to be able to run universally.
   C# translate code to IL(Intermediate Language) then through CLR, it's converted to the native code the computer uses.

4. C# groups classes by namespace, just like Java uses package. but there are some differences. see this link
