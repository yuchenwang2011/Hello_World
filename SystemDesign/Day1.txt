   Reverse Proxy:
       A reverse proxy is a web server that centralizes internal services and provides unified interfaces to the public. 
       Requests from clients are forwarded to a server that can fulfill it before the reverse proxy returns the server's response to the client.
         -- Increased security - Hide information about backend servers, blacklist IPs, limit number of connections per client
         -- Increased scalability and flexibility - Clients only see the reverse proxy's IP, allowing you to scale servers or change their configuration
  Nginx is load balancer and Reverse Proxy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpL_hJNUNEI
