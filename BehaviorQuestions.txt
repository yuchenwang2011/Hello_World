1. Introduce yourself
   My name is Yuchen, which you already know. I went to University of Vxx in 2011 and got my masters degree in 2013. 
   During which, I did 8 months coop term in Rx, now it's called Bxxx. When I was there, I was a software developer. 
   It was in Ottaxx. So after my coop term, I found another job in Ottawa, it was Acxx-luxx. I have been working there
   for 3 years as a software test engineer. Now Alxx is bought by Noxxx. So that's my work experience. Since I have been
   working as a software tester for 3 years, a little bit tired, now I want to switch to a software developer position. 
   I know Java and I'm good at data structure and algorithms. I'm detail-oriented and I know how to do quality assurance.
   So I think I can be a good candidate for this position.

2. Introduce your work at Noxxx
   First I think I need to introduce my department first. We are the most money making department in Axxxx. We do Axx's most famous
   software router. It's the very big ones, the router used by ATT, verizon, T-mobile that kind of router. 
   My team provides quality assurance to the software running on the router. It's a big produce line, so each one of
   us is responsible for a few products. 
   I have 2 main roles, first one is to test new software features introduced and new code 
   committed. I need communicate with product manager, developers, to make sure we understand the customers' requirement correctly. 
   Then I will write test plans for the features, writing code for test automations to performance kind of test cases. Looking for 
   bugs, run regression tests, etc. 
   Second one is to test the performance of the router, I need to make sure its best performance that no packets will be corrupted 
   during traffic transmission. And also no packets should be dropped. I need to write code for hardware auto configuration, service
   configuration, traffic flowing. And also write code simulating kinds of situations and control the chips threshold.

6. What is your weakness
   My weakness is that I'm kinda giving myself too much pressure. Not pressure from work, it's the pressure from family, 
   from friends, afraid to left hind, afraid can't afford a house. Sometimes got bad mood because of that, can't enjoy life.
