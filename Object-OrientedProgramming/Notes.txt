This file is the note I took during preparing OO concepts.

Basic concepts:
1. Object-oriented programming lets you extend a program without having to touch previously testd, working code. 

2. Instance variables are things an object knows about itself. They represent the state of an object. 

3. public static void main, static here means that method can be run without instantiate an instance of main. static variables and methods belongs to the class not a specific instance.
