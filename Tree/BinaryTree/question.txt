1. The height of a tree (binary or not) is defined to be the maximum distance
from the root node to any leaf node. The tree in Figure 5-2, for example, 
has a height of 4 because the path from A to F, G, or H involves four nodes.
Write a function to calculate the height of an arbitrary binary tree.
