1. Calculate a factorial of int n.

2. Binary Search: Implement a function to perform a binary search on a sorted array of 
integers to find the index of a given integer. Comment on the efficiency of this search,
 and compare it with other search methods.

3.Permutations of a string: Implement a routine that prints 
all possible orderings of the characters in a string. 
In other words, print all permutations that use all the characters from the original string. 
For example, given the string “hat”, your function should print the strings “tha”, “aht”, “tah”, 
“ath”, “hta”, and “hat”. Treat each character 
in the input string as a distinct character, even if it is repeated. 
Given the string “aaa”, your routine should print “aaa” six times.
 You may print the permutations in any order you choose.
