1. To add a folder to Github, you need first create a folder then create a file in it. 
   Github seems can’t upload a folder directly. It works with files. So you can first create file readMe.txt,
   then git add readMe.txt, then git commit -m “to add a file”. Then git push -u origin master to final commit it. 

2. git config --global user.email "yuchen.wang2011@gmail.com"
   you can use the same command but without the email in the quote “” to check if it’s set up properly. 

3. To check the status of a file, it’s:
    git status xxx.txt

4. Here is how to add a new repository to Git, first "git init newFolder" which I think it's to mkdir a new direcotory/repository. 
   Second, you make a file, such as readme there under that repo. 
   Third, you git add the file, git commit the file, same as regular commit.
   At the end, you go to the website to create a new repo, give a name, click the button to create a new repo. 
   (Here is scary, the website makes me thought I will have made a repo by clicking the create button)
   After click the create a new repo final certification button, you will be given a link for this repo. 
   Then you do "git remote add origin xxxxxx(the link)", then "git remove -v" to validate it. 
   Finally, "git push origin master" to commit the repo.
