1. Nested Classes: Nested classes are divided into two categories: static and non-static. 
   Nested classes that are declared static are called static nested classes. 
   Non-static nested classes are called inner classes.

   A nested class is a member of its enclosing class. 
   Non-static nested classes (inner classes) have access to other members of the enclosing class, 
   even if they are declared private. Static nested classes do not have access to other members of the enclosing class.
