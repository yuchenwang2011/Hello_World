1. What is the difference between SQL and MySQL?
   SQL is a language but MySQL is the rational database management system.

2. What are DDL? 
   Data Defination Language: CREATE, ALTER, DROP

3. What are DML? 
   Data Manipulating Language: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

4. What are DCL?
   Data Control Language: GRANT, REVOKE

5. Is a NULL value same as zero or a blank space? 
   No, NULL is a value is not available but zero is a integeter and space is a character.

6. If a column value taking part in an arithmetic expression is NULL, then the result obtained would be NULLM.

7. What are the case manipulation functions of SQL?
   UPPER, LOWER, INITCAP

8. What is the purpose of the NVL function?
   NVL is to convert a null to a value

9. What is the difference between the NVL and the NVL2 functions?
   The NVL(exp1, exp2) function converts the source expression (or value) exp1 to the target expression (or value) exp2, 
   if exp1 contains NULL. The return value has the same data type as that of exp1.

   The NVL2(exp1, exp2, exp3) function checks the first expression exp1, if it is not null then, 
   the second expression exp2 is returned. If the first expression exp1 is null, then the third expression exp3 is returned.
   It's a more advanced versiono of NVL

10. What is the use of the NULLIF function?
   The NULLIF function compares two expressions. If they are equal, the function returns null. 
   If they are not equal, the first expression is returned.

11. Discuss the syntax and use of the COALESCE function?
   The COALESCE function has the expression COALESCE(exp1, exp2, â€¦. expn)
   It returns the first non-null expression given in the parameter list.
   
12. Joining two tables with 20 and 10 rows respectively but forget to write the WHERE clause. What would be the result?
    Cartesian product of two tables with 20 x 10 = 200 rows.

13. What is the difference between cross joins and natural joins?
    The cross join produces the cross product or Cartesian product of two tables. 
    The natural join is based on all the columns having same name and data types in both the tables.

14. What is the purpose of the group functions in SQL? Give some examples of group functions.
    Group functions in SQL work on sets of rows and returns one result per group. 
    Examples of group functions are AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN, STDDEV, SUM, VARIANCE.
    GROUP also considerate the duplicated rows and ignores NULL

15. What are the various multiple row comparison operators in SQL?
    IN, ALL, ANY
    
16. What happens if you omit the WHERE clause in the UPDATE statement?
    All the rows in the table are modified.

17. What happens if you omit the WHERE clause in a delete statement?
    All the rows in the table are deleted.
    
18. What is the purpose of the MERGE statement in SQL?
    UPDATE if the rows exists, or an INSERT if the row does not exist.

19. What is the difference between VARCHAR2 AND CHAR datatypes?
    VARCHAR2 represents variable length character data, whereas CHAR represents fixed length character data.
    
20. A DROP TABLE statement cannot be rolled back.

21. Which SQL statement is used to add, modify or drop columns in a database table?
    ALTER
