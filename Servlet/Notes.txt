1. After configure tomcat, in Eclipse
   Right click the dynamic web project->right click->configure build path->library, add library->server runtime->add tomcat
2. Servlet is single instance, multi-threaded
3. Life Cycle:
   a. When first time visit the servlet, the server will create the servlet, call once the init() method
      and once the service() method 
   b. Every time there is a request, the server creates a thread, the thread calls the service() method once
   c. When servlet is removed, or the server is normally shutdown, server calls the destroy() method of servlet
   d. if load-on-start is set in the web.xml file, the servlet will be created and init() is called without visiting after the server is loaded.
   e. ServletConfig is created same time as the servlet, when servlet's init() method is called, the config object is passed to the servlet.
4. Each web project has 1 servert context
   it is created when project starts
   it is destroyed when server is shutdown
5. 请求方式:get和post
	 get会把参数放在url的后面 post不会
	 get参数大小有限制,post请求却没有限制
	 get请求没有请求体;post请求有请求体 请求参数放在请求体中
