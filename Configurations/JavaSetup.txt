This is a reminder how to setup java develop environment on Windows7.

1. Go to oracle, to get JDK, which is Java Developer Kit.
   (You might be confused about JDK and JRE, JDK is for developers, JRE is for ordinary people)
   Make everything should be 64 bits 
   
2. After installing JDK, go to start -> search -> command, type "java -version". For example, 1.8.0_91

3. Type "javac -version", to see if java works. Then you need go to Computer -> Property -> Advanced System Config->
   Environment Variable -> System Variable -> Path -> Edit, prepend:  C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_91\bin;
   https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/paths.html
   Then you will need to new a new System Variable, click new, then name "JAVA_HOME", path is C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_101
   ok to apply it.

4. Create a file, called Hello.java, write a Class Hello and a main method helloWorld. 

5. Type in "javac Hello.java", then type "java Hello"

6. Download an Eclipse IDE for Java Developers, for any Java developers

7. If you want to set up a maven project, go to official website and download "Binary zip archive" file, unzio it to the C:\
   Then you can have a C:\apache-maven-3.3.9\bin  . Add that to System varible path with ; Then you can try mvn -v in cmd. 

8. To open an existing project in eclipse, click File -> import -> General -> Existing project -> root directory
   -> the directory (note this dir must be put under your workspace)

9. To compile a project package with a few java files in a command line, you need do this:
   Assume the directory is: C:\Users\Yuchen\workspace\Dijkstra\src\com\Dijkstra\
   So you first goto C:\Users\Yuchen\workspace\Dijkstra\
   Then C:\Users\Yuchen\workspace\Dijkstra>javac -d bin src/com/Dijkstra/*.java
   Then C:\Users\Yuchen\workspace\Dijkstra>java -cp ./bin com.Dijkstra.TestDijkstra
   
   
For Mac Java setup:
If you didnt' install using brew, brew cask, but download JDK dmg directly, after installation, you need:
   vim ~/.bash_profile 
   export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)
   source ~/.bash_profile


For Mac Java updating to a different JDK

   export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.6.0_65-b14-462`
   3. Check now what it is the version
