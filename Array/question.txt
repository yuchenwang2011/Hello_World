1. Write an efficient function to find the first nonrepeated character in a string. 
For instance, the first nonrepeated character in “total” is 'o' and the first nonrepeated 
character in “teeter” is 'r'. Discuss the efficiency of your algorithm

2. remove specified characters 

3. reverse words: ProbLem Write a function that reverses the order of the words in a string. 
For example, your function should transform the string 
"Do or do not, there is no try." to "try. no is there not, do or Do". 
Assume that all words are space delim- ited and treat punctuation the same as letters.
