An interface declares a set of related methods, outside of any class.

An abstract class is an incomplete class definition that declares but does not define all its
methods.
========
An interface defines an application programming interface (API) that is independent of any class hierarchy. 
Interfaces are particularly important in languages that support only single inheritance, 
in which classes can inherit only one base class. 
A class that implements an interface must implement all the methods declared in the interface, and a class can implements
multiple interfaces.

An abstract class is a proper class: Unlike a concrete (nonabstract) class, some of its behaviors are deliberately left to be defined by its own subclasses. 
Abstract classes cannot be instantiated because of this â€” only instances of concrete subclasses can be created.
