==================经历问题==============================

1. ==Introduce yourself==
   My name is Yuchen, which you already know. I got my masters degree in 2013. After that I have been working as a software
   engineer. I worked for Bxx for less a year, 3 years for Nxxx, 1 year for Pxxx then now I'm working for Lxxx, which is almost 
   2 years so far. So I have worked on different sizes of companies, worked with different kinds of software.

2. ==Introduce your work at Bxxx,the technology you use==
   When I was there, my team was responsible for providing software for bb factories. You know at that time, bb's market was still not
   as bad as now. Their factory needs to manufacture thousands of products every day. The factory needs a lot of software 
   to do manufactoring and assembling for their phones. So we wrote software and maintain existing software for them. 
   For me, I had 2 main roles, first one was responsible for a few older products, to maintain the existing software. When our customer 
   the factory ask for a requirement, for example, they need change a specific configuration, I would update the code for them.
   Of course I need to guarantee nothing would be broken by my code change.
   My second role was to write some software at my spare cycle. Looking for what kind of thing that everyone on our team can benefit
   from. Duding then I wrote a windows background service running on a server to do the log file cleaning. 
   
   =SubQuestion: Can you describe the software? =
   
   There are tons of log generated everyday for a big department. Before that the manager needs to manually delete those files.
   So I wrote a clean up service running on the server that will start itself automatically to do that cleaning. The user can have
   options to choose which folder they want to clean, how old the files needs to be deleted, the log file destination. 
   The file structure was super complicated, a log of folders, folders nested with folders, different kinds of files in each level.
   It has a lot of things to consider when developing, for example, 
   Some files are hidden, some files needs certain privilege to delete. 
   Logs created 3 months ago should be deleted but if any single file in that nested folder was ever viewed by someone, 
   files in that folder should be protected. someone is currently reading a file, old folder has new files, 
   new folder has old files, what if the service can't finish its job in 24 hours and then a new service is restarted. 

3. ==Introduce your work at Nxxx==
   First I think I need to introduce my department first. We are the most money making department in Nxxxx. We do their most famous
   software router. It's the very big ones, the router used by ATT, verizon, Rogers that kind of router, big like a wall. 
   We build the software running on it. 
   I was working on the switch fabric related area. The switch fabric is a virtual data path 
   that the data, the packets flowing through. We need to guarantee the data path is always working at a high performance level. 
   No packets should be corrupted or dropped during traffic transmission. So I built the related features to monitor the performance
   under different circumstances. There are many chips in the router, different configurations can make a huge difference. So we need 
   to figure out the best paramters for the chips and FPGAs. 
   (There are small sfps, they are in a bigger MDAs, MDAs are in SFPs, then in a chassis. The sfps are connected by optical fibres, then 
   connected to the data generator.
   so there are Level 1 code written by C/C++ to control all those hardware. And we write the Level 2 commmands to connect all those 
   hardware to form an internal data path. Then on the Level 3 we write other features to monitor the performance, to dump data, 
   I was also responsible for mirroring the data)
   
4. ==Introduce your work at Vicxxx==
   I was a research assistant then. My supervisor had a project about improving current OFDM system which based on 802.11a, of course
   now no one would use that. We need to build the packets according to the 11a specification. Then build kinds of modules 
   multiplexer, demultiplexer, sending and receiving, to simualtion the signal transmitting from end to end. 
   The idea of this project is to use polar 
   coordinate instead the regular cartesian coordinate, which could save a lot of calculation of the system. We also combined soft 
   decoder inside of regular hard decoder to get a 3dm performance improvement. We also try something more that instead of floating 
   point calculation, we used fixed point and explored the minimum digits we can use for different situations but can also guarantee 
   the system's performance.

5. ==Introduce your work at Pxxx,the technology you use==
   I was a QA automation engineer there, or a QA developer. I was responsible to maintain the automation framework, 
   which is running every night, in the morning I will need to debug and figure out what fails the tests. 
   When some new feature introduced or some backend api changes, we need update the corresponding automation script. 
   Also there are a lot of manual testings need to be performed by QAs, so my job is to convert the manual testing 
   into automation code. (I left there after worked for a year because I feel the project was not very challenging.)

6. ==Introduce your work at Lxx,the technology you use==
   Do you know lxx, it's the biggest grocery store in Canada, Canada version of Walmart. For LD, we are responsible for 
   building all the e-commerce platforms, enterprise software required for the big company. We have many teams in the company,
   such as grociery, id, membership, bank, searching, fullfillment, AI, mobile. 
   I work on the Drugmart department, which is the Canada's most famous cosmetics and pharmacy store. It's like the CVS. 
   We are building the online shopping website for it. So customers can browse and shop xxxxx online.
   On backend, we use Java, SpringMVC, Oracle. From this year, we are trying to decouple the frontend and 
   backend. We don't want jsp anymore, we want to use react to replace all frontend. So backend now only provide APIs for frontend and 
   mobile apps. 
   I work most of the time as a backend developer. I'm focused on login, checkout, api 3 areas. 
   
   =Sub Question 1: what do you do for login?=
   For example, all the user related features, such as 
   a. if you are a hacker, you have 4 failed login attempt, you will be warned, if you fail 5 times, your account 
   will be temporarily locked. 
   (Details: In the DB, add 3 new fields for the user, attemptCount, activited, lastLoginTimeStamp, every time it has a
   succssful login, it will reset the value. If there is a failure, we count the failure and put it into session. 
   We will use this value in the authenticationFailureHandler. If 4 times, we warn it. If 5 times, 
   we will deactive it the account. When a user login, we will check the lastLoginTimeStamp, when it cools down, 
   the account will be activated.)
   
   b. Also when you register a new account, there will be strength meter under the password form to indicate how strong
   the password is, if it's too weak, we won't let you register.
   (Details: we used an open source library called zxcvbn, give it a string value, it will give a score how strong it is.
   We integrated on the frontend, when the user types in the pwd, it will dynamically give the score and based on the score, 
   we show a meter under the form. If it's too weak, user won't be able to submit the pwd. Backend also integrated passwordping
   api, it will pass the value to password ping server and check if the password is ever been used frequently. Then backend
   throws exception to frontend to fail register)
   
   c. From last year, we started to adopt Oauth2 login. At first we tried integrated Okta as our Oauth2 server. 
   This year we switched to Oracle IDCS service. 
   (Details: Backend will first gather all the attributes and pass to frontend. when the user clicks login, we send a call to 
   the authentication server. We registered our app on oracle. It asks the user to login enter username and password. 
   After success login, the auth server sends us an authorize code, we use the auth code to generate another call to the auth
   server, the server will send us the jwt token, it has a Id token and an access token. We use the id token for membership
   authorization, and the access token will be used to access API.)
   
   =Sub Question 2: what do you do for checkout?=
   a. We need to find out the best checkout flow by integrating google analytics, each button click on the page is recorded, 
   to figure out the best conversion rate. Then based on the analyse to rebuild frontend pages. We also user Adobe target 
   to do A/B test whenever a new feature is going to be released. 
   
   b. We also integrationed 3 sets of cybersource APIs for our credit card checkout. We use cybersource iframe for new credit card 
   payment, and CS simple order API for existing card payment and cs flex microform api. 
   To prevent fraud, we use CS decision manager and device finger print.
   (iframe Details: frontend will make a call to CS iframe endpoint to get the form confirmation. After that will send backend request 
   to get the required fields. Backend will according to previous checkout steps to generate the corresponsding required fields. 
   then frontend will fill the form with generated data. After click submit, the integrated form will send data to cybersource 
   endpoint, and it will return response with response code. Based on the code, backend will do corresponding order creation.)
   (DM Details: There are so many fraud nowadays. 
   So when CS response with the transaction code, it will have a code, which indicates the order is suspicious....)
   
   c. I also delivered a Colleague Discount Program. Call an api endpoint, decode. 
   Apply price strategy to qualified cart and entries.  
   
   =Sub Question 3: what do you do for api?=
   First we already have an existing web app, but backend and frontend is not decoupled. We use MVC to pass attributes through
   model to frontend JSP pages. This time we are going to launch a new mobile, so we want to 
   use APIs to support them, and btw decouple frontend and backend as well. 
   First of all we need to discuss with mobile developers, PMs and designers to figure out the requirements, what the response will
   be. Then we look at our current code base to figure out how many APIs we currently have, then we need map them together. 
   Then we know how many exisiting apis we have, and how many we need develop. We need to validate the existing ones to make sure
   they are as wanted. Then we split all the tickets to develop the remaining apis. 
   During the process, we need integrate Swagger UI together, which is our final delivery.
   
   =Sub Question 4: Can you draw the system structure of your web app?=

=========================简单问题===================================================
1. ==Why do you want to work for Amazon==
  Amazon is the top e-commerce company and has strong focus on customer experience. 
  so many talented people working here and using the latest Technologies to make people's life easier. 
  people always have ownership and always trying their best to make their project perfect. 
  I really like those spirits. I'm also working with LD, BB platform, this is also an position to help customers life easier. 
  
  Second i'm applying for AWS. AWS uses the latest technology and its the best Cloud solution in the world. 
  millions of website there's deployed to it and billions of people are affected by it. 
  every single line of code change can make a big impact to help more customers.
   
2. ==What is your strength?==
   My strengh is that I am a self - starter, I don't need any supervision. I have a very strong sense of ownership.
   I always work my best and hardest to finish my tasks.  
   
3. ==What is your weakness==
   My weakness is that I'm kinda giving myself too much pressure. Not pressure from work, it's the pressure from family, 
   from friends, afraid to left hind. Sometimes got bad mood because of that, can't enjoy life. 
  
4. ==What was your biggest challenge?==
   Well, my biggest challenge was that when I first got hired by Axxxxxx, there was a probation period. I was given 2 month time to 
   finish my first project. I was a fresh graduate then and I didn't know anything about the work my team was doing. They wanted to 
   check if I am a fast learner. So I did my best, reading code to learn the APIs and the coding conventions here, checking twikis
   about things I need to consider, asking people the logic behind the code and asking people about the knowledge of our product,
   writing notes, working overtime to write my own code. So I proved my ability to learn fast and I managed to finish the project
   from scrach to release. 
   
Most challenging project
The most challenging project is my current xx project. It is challenging because I need to implement all the new features on my own. It requires me to build machine learning tools for network threat hunting, I haven’t done anything related to threat hunting before. And It also requires me to build RESTful APIs for the tools. I haven’t developed any RESTful API before either. It also requires me to build alerting system and But the time is not unlimited, so I started to devote more time on the project, even my private time. I googled a lot of papers related to threat hunting, like malicious url, dnstuneling, network behavior. When I came up with some ideas, I would discuss with my manager to make sure the plan is feasible. And then I learnt Go as quick as possible so that I can design and implement all the RESTful APIs on time. Finally, all the new features have been implemented on time and we received positive feedbacks from the customer. So through this process, I learnt that it is so important to be curious and keep learning, the more you read and learn, the more problems you can solve. The feeling of ownership is really really important, the product is just like your own child. So “I don’t know how to do it” will never be the excuse.

5. ==What was your biggest achievement?==   
   
6. ==What was your most difficult / proud of project? 1你从这个项目中学到了什么? 2. 有什么是以前不会的？做完之后就会了。==
   The project I'm most proud of is that during my work at Nxxx, I wrote a big code automation that can save a lot of effort.
   Before I took that part of testing, every time we introduce a new module, I need to do a lot of manual configurations and write 
   some code specifically for it. Then I used my spare time to write an interface to accept all kinds of modules, every new module
   introduced, I just need to write some basic information into it. And I subtracted the things in common and tests in common as
   a whole, integrate them together. And I integrated the performance check tests that makes checking performance a standard.
   So after I build the system, I can save a lot of time testing new modules.

7. ==What can you bring to us?==
    My sense of responsibility. I am a person having a very high standard of myself and want to make my release perfect and free of 
    bugs. I will feel a shame to fail release and not working my best. I've been doing software testing for 3 years, I know how
    to quality control and make my code less bugs. 

8. ==Why should we hire u? / why do u think urself a good fit for this position?==
    I have worked in a big company for 3 years. So I know how to teamwork with coworkers, how to interact with deverlopers, 
    testers, product managers things like that. I know how to write code of a certain standard. I know how to provide quality
    control and decrease the chance of bugs.

9. ==How can you improve your coding ability?==
    For example, during my work, when I have spare time, I don't relax. I would read other people's code, assuming if I were them,
    how I would write my code here. And we do code reviews, I can get feedback from other people, this really helps a lot.  
    I would also spend quite a lot of time to read API documents. The more I'm familiar with it, I can write better code. 
    
10. ==How would other people describe you?==
    People describe me a person with sense of responsibilities. They can trust me and rely on me.
    
11. ==Plans about ur career growth path?==
    I want to be a java expert

==================TeamWork==============================

1. Tell me about your teamwork experience
    Once my team was suddenly notified that we shoud deliver a feature in a month. That was so rush because we are usually 
    notified at least 3 months before release. So I and another team member rose to the accasion. We two took the project 
    and collaborate. He knows configuring the hardware better and I know the feature related knowledge better. 
    Then he wrote the configuring part of the code first then gave them to
    me. I then build my code on top of his, to test the feature. At last, we managed to finish that in time.

21. when you made a mistake and how you correct it?

The biggest mistake you made and what did you learn from it? (earn trust, customer obsession)
Case 1: The biggest mistake I’ve made happened when I led the smartloganalyzer project for the first time. The original schedule is week, but I suddenly received a message from my manager says that he will show a smartloganalyzer demo to one customer after two days. And at that time I was working on building the alerting system, that will be an important part of the demo. But I paid too much attention on details, I want to make everything perfect. I didn’t notice that I don’t have enough time to finish all the details. Last day before the demo day, my manager pointed that out. I apologized to him and then we started to figure out if there is a way to keep the demo the same as what we want it to be, but sacrificing some backend performance that customer won’t notice, cause it is just a demo. After the demo, I can rewrite the code to meet my requirements. Fortunately, the demonstration was not affected in the end. But from this mistake, I learnt that details are definitely important, but I also need to pay attention to the whole schedule, I need to always keep good communication with my teammates when I have my plan. I need to make sure that my schedule won’t affect other’s schedule.

Case 2: I apologized to my manager and the customer. And we added the python 2 envrionment to a new sensor as soon as possible and sent it to customer again. So, after that, I learnt that I should pay attention to each small detail during the development process, and document them in time so that we won’t forget. I need to make sure that all the things I delivered are fully qualified.




22. Describe a situation where you exceeded expectations/did more than required

23. describe a time you use a smart way to solve a difficult problem

24. tell me about a time you have Two ways of implementation, you choose which way and why

**********************************Amazon Principles****************************************
每个都要有3个例子, 一正一反，争取不同角度
==Customer Obsession==
   Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. 
   Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.
   1. 以重视客户为荣，以重视对手为耻
   例子: 1. 不能右键打开PDP，can't right click the product to open new tabs. back customer experience but designers don't agree with it. 
         performed a survey among the company to prove and persuaded designers, marketing, product teams.
         2. Lighter PDP
         3. Beauty Advisor don't login. login takes long time and also user worry about their account safety
Case 1: When I led the smartloganalyzer project at the first time, it is very challenging to me. Cause I have no idea how to build the threat hunting structure. In order to understand it better, I googled a lot of papers and learnt a lot of basic concepts about network threat hunting. Based on that, I started to work with customers to figure out what kind of problems that customers concerned the most. Cause most customers who are using our products are not professional network developer. We need to use their language to tell them the story. They just need to know if they are under specific threats, they don’t care about how we find the threats. All they need to do is just make easy  decisions based on the suggestions we provide. The system will take care of all the other stuff. Like if there are brute force password attacking, the system will bubble up an alert and send an email to customer to let them know, and also providing them the links to the detailed dashboards. They can choose the suggestions provided by system, like putting the ip into the banlist.
So, finally, after the delivery, we get positive feedbacks from customers. We are always trying our best to listen to our customers and provide the best experience for them.


In order to understand the process thoroughly, I made several appointments with the engineering team, going through the specification building process with them step by step in detail. Then, I did some field observations, looking at how engineers use their ipads and computers in the field and in the office, when and how they input the data to complete a detail specification. Based on what I’ve learned and observed, I was able to come up with data schemas, draft a working prototype, and bring it to the engineers to collect feedback.
It turned out that the prototype was very helpful, it saved us around 10% time when implementing the web application. 
The customer was obsessed with our professional process and result, and start to have more business with us.

==Ownership==
   Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. 
   They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job". 
   2. 以担当为荣，以逃避为耻
   例子: 1. I always have a strong sense of ownership, even my director praised me many times for my sense of ownership. 
         We do have support team to solve some issues and slack channels. And after work people don't usually check their phones.
         I always check. for example, extra calls made for shopping bag, it's frontend issue, I still jump in to support 
         at the weekend.
         2. SEO
         3.
         Case 1: When I worked on the SLA project, I was required to deploy elastalert and create few rules for the alerting system. Our alerting system is based on various elasticsearch indexes, and the situations and requirements for each index are definitely different. Since I was the person who was leading SLA project, I want my customers to always have the best experience. So I started to think about automate the generation. After the agreement from my manager, I categorized the current rules and the future rules based on different scenarios and requirements. Then I wrote a bunch of shell scripts to do the automation. I also created the APIs for those alerts, so if the customer doesn’t want the rule to be enabled, he can just click on website to turn it off. After delivery, we had strong positive feedbacks from customer.

==Invent and Simplify==
   Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. 
   They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here". 
   As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.
   3. 以创新为荣，以复杂为耻
   例子: 1. creating scripts to simplify the onboarding process. Even in last company, wrote a lot of scripts. 
         2. 
         3. 
         Case 1: When I worked at CCG, we have a ticketing system to record the development process, keep tracking all the tasks, bugs. But you know the ticketing system is a little bit crowded. It only shows a long list of tickets. With the first glance, you can hardly know current process of development. So to simplify it, I used a vis timeline to show all the tickets. Then we can see the whole process clearly through the timeline. With the timeline, we can schedule the tasks more easily. Everyone is happy with that.

==Are Right, A Lot==
   Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work 
   to disconfirm their beliefs.
   4. 以多元角度为荣，以固守己见为耻
   例子: 跟队友争执的例子.
   Case 1: When I was building the alerting system through elastalert, I was asked to create rules for monitoring all the processes in the system. I have my initial plan to track the unique value of process names based on different sensors. But I don’t quite understand the behavior of system index, so I discussed with my manage, and he disagreed with plan. Actually we want to see the alert when the system is down, or nearly down. What we really care about is the count of processes. We want to alert when there is a significant drop in process numbers. So, after that I changed my design and everyone is happy.

   My manager asked me if there’s a way to export and import kibana dashboards, visuals more easily. Cause through the GUI side, it has the number limit and it is hard to manipulate from back end. So I came up with an idea we can utilize the REST apis kibana and elasticsearch provide. We can write scripts to automate the loading process according to our own needs. I know that’s feasible. So finally I wrote the scripts and all the stuff in kibana can be exported and imported automatically in back end.

==Hire and Develop The Best==
   Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, 
   and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others.  
   We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.
   6. 以提高表现为荣，以埋没天才为耻
   例子: i'm responsible for interviewing and hiring. always let interviewee better than half of the people. Coaching others.
   Case 1: Few months ago, there was an intern assigned to my project. He was helping me build the alerting system. But I found that he gets lost about what we are doing and what he is going to do. So, I told him that it is not as complex as what he is thinking about. I explained the alerting concepts to him one by one and categorized the things what we are doing and what we are going to do. After he is getting comfortable of the whole environment and what I need him to do, I started to assign him the specific task. And he is doing pretty well. So when someone comes to a new environment, getting lost is quite normal. We need to have patience to make him get comfortable of the while environment. Otherwise the efficiency will be very low. And that will also help him get used to the working environment quickly and increase his enthusiasm and devote more to the work.

==Insist on the Highest Standards==
   Leaders have relentlessly high standards - many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. 
   Leaders are continually raising the bar and driving their teams to deliver high quality products, services and processes. 
   Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.
   7. 以严格标准为荣，以产品缺陷为耻
   例子: sonarqube cognitive score too high, insist the bar.
   测试login，各种test case，尽管ticket就叫干啥了。我还测试了啥
   Case 1: When I was building the alerting system, one of the important features is to generate alerting rules automatically. But I found that if the indexes are in a large scale, or we meet some edge cases,  the efficiency of the process will be very low. Cause we are generating a lot of duplicate rules. So I built the cache to story the previous status, if there are new alerts happening or new indexes, then the system will create corresponding new rules for them. Otherwise it will only update them or do nothing. Also if there are old rules that we do not need anymore, we will remove them. And I also created links for those rules, so that we can save some disk space. It turned out that the efficiency was improved a lot.

   • Tell me about your proudest professional achievement.
My proudest professional achievement is the SLA project I owned. I tried my best to make it look perfect and make my customers have best experience. I build the machine learning tools for network threat hunting, each network anomaly and malicious event will be reported to the system. And I also created the alerting system, so that we don’t need people to sit there monitoring the boring data and create rules by hands. The alerting system will do all the stuff automatically. Customers love that, cause it really saves them a lot of time and money.
   • Tell me about a time when you went way beyond the scope of the project and delivered.
When the first version of SLA that with machine learning feature was delivered, I was starting to think about moving the machine learning platform to tensorflow. Cause one of our core features is to analyze the behavior of network. But each network has its own environment and their behaviors are definitely different, so we need to build specific judging rules and awarding rules to let it train itself. So that it can always have good performance regarding to each environment. And I’m still working on that.

   • Tell me about a time where you overcame an obstacle and delivered results.

I will use my private time to keep working on the task. After all, finishing the task with high quality as soon as possible is what we want. I’ll never sacrifice the customer experience or the quality of the product because of that. Customer experience is always the most important. We must make sure that the product we are gonna deliver is qualified. We can sacrifice our own time to try to finish the tasks. If we still can not finish the tasks, we will communicate with customers and related people, to tell them why and earn their trust. At the same time, we will try our best to finish the tasks as soon as possible.

DELIVER RESULTS: Tell me about a time where you overcame an obstacle and delivered results.
First, I’d check every possible way that could possibly make me hit the date, like using after-work time, weekends, or holidays, asking for help or suggestions, finding alternatives or simpler solutions, etc. Since I am the owner of the tasks, it’s my responsibility to deliver results on time. It’s my fault that I underestimated the workload when I took the tasks.
There was one time that we couldn’t finish the troubleshooting of a bug on time, the system should have sent out auto emails at 7:00 am but sometimes it failed. Before solving the problem, I will check each morning and manually trigger emails to the client.
If I still couldn’t hit the date, I would look at features, pick out a few with highest priority that I could finish, and then discuss about the problem with the project manager. Of course, I would apologize first and then try to discuss about the best solution to minimize the impacts. Once the project manager agrees, I would notify all the people that could be impacted by the delay.
