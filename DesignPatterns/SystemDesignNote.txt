Don't panic, here are some Example Questions :
  1. Design a URL shortening service like bit.ly.
  2. How would you implement the Google search?
  3. Design a client-server application which allows people to play chess with one another.
  4. How would you store the relations in a social network like Facebook and implement a feature where one user receives notifications 
     when their friends like the same things as they do?
