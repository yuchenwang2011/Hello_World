Don't panic, here are some Example Questions :
  1. Design a URL shortening service like bit.ly.
  2. How would you implement the Google search?
  3. Design a client-server application which allows people to play chess with one another.
  4. How would you store the relations in a social network like Facebook and implement a feature where one user receives notifications 
     when their friends like the same things as they do?

  vertical scaling : make a single server better CPU, RAM, Disk
  horizontal scaling : instead of making a super expensive and good server, we can use several cheaper and old server instead
  load balancer: a blackbox module connecting clients and our backend servers, to distribute those client requests through the servers
  Database partioning: for example, users' name  A-M save into first 3 mysql servers, N-Z user names save into another 3 mysql servers
                       that gives you redundancy.
