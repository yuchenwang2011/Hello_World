1. C# vs .NET
   C# is the programming language
   .Net is the framework for building applications on Windows
   .NET is used to be compared with JVM.

2. .NET has 2 main components:
   CLR: Common Language Runtime. It makes it possible for C# code to run on different hardware different platforms.
   Class Library

3. C# learned the idea from Java that JVM translate the code to byte code to be able to run universally.
   C# translate code to IL(Intermediate Language) then through CLR, it's converted to the native code the computer uses.

4. C# groups classes by namespace, just like Java uses package. but there are some differences. see this link
   http://www.javacamp.org/javavscsharp/namespace.html

5. JIT Compilation is the compilation of IL code to machine code at runtime. JIT is short for Just In Time compilation. 

6. The console project is the simplest project to work on. To print a hello word same as in Java.
   Use: console.Writeline("Hello world"); Then press ctrl + F5 to compile. 
   
7. ReSharper is a very useful tool to improve Visual studio productivity, which gives you 30 days free trial.

8. What is an assembly?
   A single unit of deployment of .net applications. It's a file, in the form of an executable or a DLL, that contains 
   many classes and namespaces. When you have more and more namespaces, you can put relavent namespaces together as 
   an assembly. An EXE file is a program to be executed. DLL is a file that includes code that to be re-used across 
   different programs.
